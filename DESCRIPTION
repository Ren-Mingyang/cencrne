Description: The network analysis plays an important role in numerous application domains including biomedicine. 
             Estimation of the number of communities is a fundamental and critical issue in network analysis. Most existing studies assume that the number of communities is known a priori, or lack of rigorous theoretical guarantee on the estimation consistency. This method proposes a regularized network embedding model to simultaneously estimate the community structure and the number of communities in a unified formulation. 
	           The proposed model equips network embedding with a novel composite regularization term, which pushes the embedding vector towards its center and collapses similar community centers with each other. A rigorous theoretical analysis is conducted, establishing asymptotic consistency in terms of community detection and estimation of the number of communities.
